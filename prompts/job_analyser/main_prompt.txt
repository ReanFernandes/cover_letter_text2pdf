Guidelines:
- context: 1-2 sentences about what makes this company/role uniquely interesting or different. Focus on their mission, unique technology, or market position - NOT generic job responsibilities.
- research_topics: ONLY include specific technical research areas, proprietary methodologies, or company-specific initiatives that are central to their work. Do NOT include employee benefits, generic technical terms (like "AI", "machine learning"), or common job requirements.
- Extract 5-10 most important technical skills for each category
- Keywords to emphasize should be domain-specific terms that appear multiple times or seem central to the role
- Company values should be explicitly stated principles or cultural values from the posting
- Be specific with technical skills (e.g., "PyTorch" not just "deep learning framework")
- For experience level, choose the best fit from: entry, mid, senior, lead
- If no specific research topics are mentioned, return an empty array
